# 👋 Hi, I’m [Sarvan Maurya](https://github.com/SarvanMaurya123)

# My Information

I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel-perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.

I began my journey as a web developer in my second year college, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Currently, as a third-year student, I’m focusing on developing my skills and working on projects that allow me to apply what I’ve learned.

I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.

When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me exploring new technologies, learning, and enjoying some free time. You can follow me on linkedin, where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can find me on GitHub.

Finally, some quick bits about me:

BSC IT (Information Technology).

I am dedication to learning and improving your skills while still studying.
